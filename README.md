# Spotify-song-recommendation-system
As a popular music streaming service, it is used by a large number of people all over the world on a daily basis. One way in which Spotify keeps its users not only satisfied with, but also hooked to the platform, is by making smart and personal recommendations to users based on their listening history.

Such recommendation systems are used by many more companies to provide a highly personal user experience.

In this notebook, I will be developing a basic content-based recommendation system for Spotify. This begins with a gentle introduction to content-based recommendation systems and the underlying concepts. Further, I will be performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before going on to build the recommendation system.
Content-based Recommendation Systems
Recommender systems are active information filtering systems which personalize the information coming to a user based on their interests, relevance of the information etc. Recommender systems are used widely for recommending movies, articles, restaurants, places to visit, items to buy etc.

Simply put, recommendation systems "recommend" personalized content on the basis of user’s past/current preference to improve the user experience. Broadly, there are two types of recommendation systems – Content-based & Collaborative filtering based.
